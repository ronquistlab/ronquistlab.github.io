    <p>The Ronquist lab is an interactive and interdisciplinary environment, where we focus on innovative research at the interface between statistics, computer science, evolutionary biology, and insect diversity. We have co-authored some of the leading software packages for Bayesian analysis of phylogenetic problems, and continue to develop new computational approaches, models and inference strategies. The current focus is on universal probabilistic programming. In our empirical research on insect diversity and evolution, we also strive to explore new directions. Recent examples include deep learning for automated image-based identification, improved methods for finding genes linked to life-history changes, more efficient molecular techniques for rapid species discovery, and genetic analyses that scale so that we can analyze the composition and function of entire insect faunas and their associated microbiomes.</p>

<p><strong>Large-scale integrative taxonomy (LIT) paper is out</strong><br />
2022-07-21
<br /><br />
Large-scale integrative taxonomy (LIT) is a new, rapid, systematic and objective species delimitation method specifically designed for tackling “dark taxa". Dark taxa are defined in the paper as groups for which <10% of all species are described and the estimated diversity exceeds 1,000 species. Due to the sheer numbers of species and specimens in these groups, coupled with the complexity of both molecular and morphological species determination, multiple data sources must be used to delimit species ("integrative taxonomy"). To make collecting this much data an efficient and scalable practice, LIT relies on preliminary species hypotheses that are generated based on inexpensive data (in the paper, COI barcodes) that can be obtained quickly and cost-effectively. These hypotheses are then validated using a more expensive type of data that is only obtained for specimens selected based on objective criteria applied to the preliminary species hypotheses (in the paper, morphology). The paper developed and tested LIT using a dataset of 18,000 scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) that were first grouped into 315 putative species based on barcode data. Using LIT, approximately 1000 specimens (6% of total) were selected for morphological examination. LIT reveals that it is possible to predict the molecular clusters likely to be incongruent with species boundaries, and to objectively pick a small subset of specimens to use for validation.

<p><strong>Emily Hartop's thesis defence: A multifaceted approach to a "dark taxon"</strong><br />
2021-06-08
<br /><br />
On the 8<sup>th</sup> of June Emily Hartop successfully defended her PhD thesis: <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1544804&dswid=5692">A multifaceted approach to a "dark taxon"</a>. A dark taxon is a hyperdiverse yet understudied taxonomic group. 
  Her work focused on the scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae), including for example a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis on the scuttle fly genus <i>Megaselia</i>, as well as method developments for large-scale species discovery and description. 

  <br /><br />
  
Emily is now a researcher on Hyperdiverse Diptera at <a href="https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en">the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin</a>.

<p><strong>Universal probabilistic programming offers a powerful approach to statistical phylogenetics</strong><br />
2021-02-24
<br /><br />
In a paper appearing online today in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01753-7">Communications Biology</a>, we outline our recent work in probabilistic programming, 
  and demonstrate that universal probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) solve the expressivity problem that exists in phylogenetic analysis, while still supporting automated generation of efficient inference algorithms.
The paper presents automated generation of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms for PPL descriptions of arbitrary biological diversification (birth-death) models. Applying these methods to 40 bird phylogenies we show that models with slowing diversification, constant turnover and many small shifts generally explain the data best.
  
    <br /><br />
  
  The field of probabilistic programming is currently in a phase of experimentation, and few hurdles remain before these techniques can be effectively applied to the full range of phylogenetic models.

<p><strong> Effects of ethanol concentration on insect preservation</strong><br />
2021-02-12 <br /><br />
<p>In a paper published today in <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/10799/">PeerJ</a>, we study the effects of ethanol concentration on the preservation of insects >. High concentrations of ethanol are widely believed to make insects brittle, justifying the preservation of insect specimens for morphological study in 70-80% ethanol. However, recent taxonomic and phylogenetic research is usually based on DNA sequencing, and DNA is better preserved at much higher concentrations. This causes a trade-off between morphological and molecular preservation that has rarely been studied to date.

<br /><br />

We analyzed the effects of different ethanol concentrations on morphological and molecular preservation in seven insect species. We found that robust species suffer little morphological damage at high ethanol concentrations, and there is noticeable degradation of their DNA at intermediate to low concentrations. In contrast, weakly sclerotized species were susceptible to damage in high concentrations of ethanol, but their DNA was preserved well also in intermediate concentrations of ethanol. Interestingly, at concentrations of around 90%, the preservation of both morphology and DNA was acceptable for most species.

High-throughput sequencing methods are revolutionizing biodiversity monitoring. In a perspective piece published today in <a href=”https:// doi.org/10.1111/mec.15797”>Molecular Ecology</a>, resulting from a November 2019 workshop in Cyprus, we contribute to recommendations for how current and future projects using these new approaches to study biodiversity can be more effectively connected to provide a site-based genomic framework for global integration and synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Phylogeny of scuttle flies</strong><br />
2021-01-09
<br /><br />

The scuttle fly genus <i>Megaselia</i> is one of the most species-rich in the animal kingdom, with roughly 1,700 described species and probably at least an order of magnitude more species remaining to be discovered. In large part because of the enormous diversity, phylogenetic relationships within the genus are still very poorly known, complicating further taxonomic work on the radiation. In a paper appearing online today in <a href=”https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.sub.su.se/doi/10.1111/syen.12448”>Systematic Entomology</a>, we present the first <br /><br />
comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of relationships within the genus.

<br /><br />

We find that most of the species diversity of <i>Megaselia</i> is found within a “core” clade. Future restriction of the genus to this lineage would render it monophyletic but it would necessitate the recognition of a few lineages outside of the core lineage as separate genera.

<br /><br />

Within the core <i>Megaselia</i>, we identify twenty-two well-supported species groups. This establishes an important phylogenetic scaffold based on DNA sequence data that will facilitate future exploration of the radiation. Nevertheless, many relationships within the genus will continue to be poorly resolved until it becomes possible to significantly expand both the species representation and the amount of sequence data. </p>

    <p><strong>Unique insect data published</strong><br />
      2020-11-24
      <br /><br />
      The Swedish Malaise Trap Project (SMTP) is q unique contrywide inventory of a national insect fauna. The field campaign was completed in 2003-2006, and sampled the insect fauna at 73 different selected sites across the ccountry using Malaise traps. The entire catch is estimated to contain some 20 million insect specimens. This unique project is now described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.8.e47255">a recent paper of ours</a> in Biodiversity Data Journal. More than 100 taxonomic experts have participated in the identification of the material so far. Around 170,000 specimens, about 1 &percnt; of the total material, have been determined to species. What is unique about these data is that they are focused to a large extent on poorly known groups in the insect orders Hymenoptera and Diptera, groups that are rarely processed in similar inventories for lack of taxonomic expertise. The available SMTP data have recently been published to GBIF as 79 sample-based datasets, as described in <a href="https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/56286/list/9/">another recent paper</a> of ours, also in Biodiversity Data Journal.

      <br /><br />
      Thanks in large part to the SMTP inventory, the known Swedish insect fauna has increased with 2,000 species in the last decade, to 28,000 species. Our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228561">recent analysis</a> based on the inventory data suggests that as many as 5,000 additional insect species may still remain to be discovered in Sweden, many of them likely new to science. Most of the remaining species belong to Hymenoptera and Diptera, and many of them are decomposers or parasitoids.</p>
