      Since high school, I have been interested in insects and in
      computational biology, an unusual combination that has worked
      well for me in my research career. For my thesis, I studied the
      phylogeny and evolution of gall wasps and their relatives, and I
      still keep an active interest in this group, but also in insect
      diversity more broadly. On the computational side, I have worked
      for a long time with the development of Bayesian techniques for
      the analysis of phylogenetic problems. I enjoy interdisciplinary
      research and encourage my students and postdocs to explore new
      approaches and combine methods and perspectives from different
      disciplines.

      I am the <a href="https://www.insectbiomeatlas.com/">Insect
      Biome Atlas </a> project research manager. I am responsible for
      the implementation of the project and this involves doing a
      little bit of everything; general project overseeing, leading
      the operational, logistics and administrative tasks, managing
      fieldwork and labwork, keeping an eye on the budget, and,
      together with the PI´s of the project, conducting and overseeing
      the research. I have a PhD in evolutionary biology from the
      University of East Anglia, UK and several years´ experience as a
      postdoc at the University of Helsinki and the Natural History
      Museum of Denmark. Apart from making sure that IBA runs
      smoothly, I also try to keep up with my research on global
      patterns of genetic diversity.

      geneticist interested in uncovering and understanding the
      diversity of life. Currently I am working within the Insect
      Biome Atlas to develop and implement novel metabarcoding
      protocols to describe insect fauna of Sweden and
      Madagascar. Comprehensive sampling of insects both in time and
      space allows us to understand how insect communities are
      distributed and how they react to changing environment. Outside
      of research I have passion for science outreach and
      bio-hacking. Read more about my current and past projects

	Since March 2022, I am working as a post doc on the Insect Biome Atlas project. 
	For my current project, I am interested in describing the composition of insect communities through space and time, the effects of environment and climate on the composition of insect communities, 
	as well as the consequences for ecosystem functioning. My scientific interests have always revolved around insects and species interactions. 
	During my master thesis, I studied brain plasticity of generalist and specialist butterflies during host plant search. 
	I obtained my PhD at Stockholm University, where I studied the interactions between plants, microbes and insects in a spatio-temporal context.

I am an ecologist with broad interests in the processes that drive population dynamics, community structure, and species richness across regions. 
	    I have a particular interest in combining novel technologies and methodologies to collect data over large spatial scales, and developing empirically backed models to investigate the responses of populations and communities to their drivers. 
	    I studied for my PhD at The University of Sheffield, where I undertook research on developing methods to investigate the dynamics of plant populations with large-spatial distributions. 
	    Now, I’m currently working on the insect biome atlas project where we’re aiming to understand the assembly rules that drive the structure and dynamics of insect communities in Sweden and Madagascar.

Since May 2021 I am a Researcher in the Ronquist lab, working in the MISTRA-funded Finance to Revive Biodiversity program: <a href="https://finbio.org" target="_blank">FinBio</a>. 
	Here I combine my experience with research and environmental monitoring, focusing on analyzing biodiversity data for financial metrics. I work with probabilistic programming and contribute to several other projects including on diversification models, insect metabarcoding and the co-evolution of plants and butterflies.

Because of my training, I usually try to address biological questions with a molecular approach, and I rely a lot on sequencing techniques and bioinformatics. The main focus of my research is the biology of Cynipids, a family of galling insects. Currently I'm working on the evolutionary history of the family as a whole, as well as the genetic basis of gall induction in the genus Andricus

      My research uses statistical modeling, Bayesian inference, Big Data, and computer vision to understand morphological evolution and macroevolutionary patterns and processes. As a postdoc in the Ronquist lab, I worked on developing probabilistic models of morphological evolution for phylogenetic inference, specifically focusing on detecting correlation structure in large “phenomic” datasets using both discrete state and continuous multivariate normal models. 
      Currently, I am a researcher in the Department of Geological Sciences at Stockholm University, where I am using high-throughput imaging and machine learning to study the morphological evolution of planktonic foraminifera across the K-Pg mass extinction with the goal of correlating community-level morphological patterns with paleoenvironmental records.

      I did a PhD in Ecology at Stockholm University and was co-supervised by Fredrik. For my thesis, I combined host use records, phylogenetic information, network theory, and computer simulations to study the relationship between the evolution of butterfly-host plant interactions and butterfly diversification. We have also developed a model of host-repertoire evolution that is available in RevBayes and is applicable to a variety of host-symbiont systems.
